QUESTION 1: How many hashes did you use as FindMinHash's parameter to achieve a 30 to 45 second runtime: 

Number of Hashes (example: 750,000,000): 
Number of Seconds (example: 30.870s): 

Note: We're only interested in the "real" seconds for this question.


QUESTION 2: Provide the full ``time`` output for your program, with 1 to 16 threads. **Ensure that the result is identical for all 16 runs.** You can run all of these with a single bash command if you like (replace 750000000 with your Number of Hashes from QUESTION 1): 

``for i in {1..16} ; do time java FindMinHash 750000000 $i ; done``

Example Timing (first 2 of 16 runs only on Antares):

ricegf@antares$ for i in {1..16} ; do time java FindMinHash 750000000 $i ; done

YOUR Timing:




QUESTION 3: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program slightly?  Why or why not?




QUESTION 4: Does adding more threads increase the "system load", or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?




BONUS
=====

QUESTION 5: Time your thread pool version of FindMinHash as you did for the full credit version. Is a thread pool faster, slower, or roughly equivalent in performance? 


YOUR Timing:




QUESTION 6: Compare the full credit and bonus solutions. Which do you believe is more supportable over a long lifetime of evolving hardware and environments?
